# X-Ray AI: Medical Image Analysis iOS App

## Overview

X-Ray AI is a powerful iOS application that leverages machine learning to analyze chest X-ray images and assist in the detection of various respiratory conditions. The app uses CoreML and Vision frameworks to provide real-time analysis of chest X-rays, helping identify conditions such as COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal cases.

## Features

- Real-time chest X-ray image analysis
- High-accuracy classification of multiple conditions:
  - COVID-19 (99% accuracy when detected)
  - Bacterial Pneumonia
  - Viral Pneumonia
  - Normal chest X-rays
- Detailed analysis reports with confidence scores
- Visual severity indicators

### 2. Smart Analysis

- Multi-class classification with confidence scores
- Alternative diagnoses with probability percentages
- Detailed descriptions of findings
- Customized medical recommendations

### 3. History Tracking

- Comprehensive history of all analyses
- Searchable diagnosis history
- Date-based grouping of results
- Ability to review past analyses

### 4. User Interface

- Modern SwiftUI interface
- Intuitive image selection
- Clear visualization of results
- Easy-to-understand medical insights
- Dark mode support
